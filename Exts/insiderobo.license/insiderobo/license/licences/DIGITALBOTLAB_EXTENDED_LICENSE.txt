2. Content licenses

Digital Bot Lab is providing you with a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and non-transferable permission to globally utilize, adapt (except as explicitly restricted here), and duplicate the Content. This authorization is granted for the duration of the protected intellectual property rights as allowed by the applicable license and subject to the outlined restrictions in this agreement.

2.1. Standard License
The Standard License gives you permission to utilize the Content you've acquired. You are authorized to employ the Content in a single End Product for either your personal use or for a single Client, and this End Product can be distributed at no cost.

You have the following permissions:
Utilize the Content in a single End Product for personal use.
Employ the Content in a single End Product for a Client, transfer that End Product to your Client, and charge them for your services. The license is then transferred to the Client.
Modify the Content or combine it with other works to create derivative works. The resulting work is subject to this license. This clause also covers extracting individual components from the Content and using them in derivative works.
However, there are certain restrictions:
You cannot use the Content in an End Product that is intended for sale to one or more paying End Users.
You cannot use the Content in more than one unique End Product. This license is for a "single application" and not for "multi-use." If you plan to use the same Content for another End Product, you must purchase additional licenses.
You cannot use your license for multiple organizations. For example, if you are a development agency, you can only transfer your license to one customer.
Redistributing the Content's source, even after modification, is not allowed.
Using the Content in applications that enable End Users to customize the Content, such as "build it yourself" or "theme generators," is prohibited. You can purchase separate licenses for each final product that incorporates the Content created using such applications.
Allowing the End User of the End Product to access the Content's source and use it separately from the End Product is also not permitted.
If the Content includes code, images, or materials obtained from other sources with different licenses, those elements maintain their original licensing terms. The specific license for such code, images, or materials will be indicated by the Content's creator. It is your responsibility to comply with the original license terms or obtain clearance from the author of the code, image, or material.
This license can be terminated if you violate its terms, resulting in the loss of your rights to distribute the End Product until the Content has been completely removed from it.
The creator of the Content retains ownership of the Content but grants you a license based on these conditions. This licensing agreement is strictly between you and the Content's creator, and Digital Bot Lab is not a party to this license or the one who grants it to you.

2.2. Extended License

The Extended License provides you with the privilege to utilize the Content you've acquired. You are permitted to employ the Content in a single End Product for either personal use or for one Client (referred to as a "single application"), and this End Product may be offered for sale or distributed free of charge.

You have the following permissions:
Utilize the Content in a single End Product for personal use.
Employ the Content in a single End Product for a Client, transfer that End Product to your Client, and charge them for your services. The license is then transferred to the Client.
Modify the Content or combine it with other works to create derivative works. The resulting work is subject to this license. This clause also covers extracting individual components from the Content and using them in derivative works.

Allowing the End User of the End Product to access the Content's source and use it separately from the End Product is also not permitted.
If the Content includes code, images, or materials obtained from other sources with different licenses, those elements maintain their original licensing terms. The specific license for such code, images, or materials will be indicated by the Content's creator. It is your responsibility to comply with the original license terms or obtain clearance from the author of the code, image, or material.
This license can be terminated if you violate its terms, resulting in the loss of your rights to distribute the End Product until the Content has been completely removed from it.

2.3. Design License
This license is exclusively applicable to the design kits known as Digital Twin Starter. For the sake of clarity within this section, an editor is defined as an individual who utilizes design assets, whether directly or indirectly, in the creation or modification of digital twin designs.

Under the Design License, you are granted the privilege to utilize the Content you've acquired. You are authorized to employ the Content in an unlimited number of End Products, which may either be sold or distributed at no cost.

In terms of the required quantity of licenses, it is essential that the number of licenses procured aligns with the maximum number of editors working concurrently within a 24-hour timeframe. An editor, in this context, refers to a person who contributes changes to the designed screens that incorporate the Content. Notably, there is no need for licenses when it comes to viewing designs that include the Content.

You have the following permissions:
Share the Content in your team's library and utilize it within your organization, provided you acquire licenses for each editor. No licenses are needed for viewing designs that incorporate the Content.
Generate an unlimited number of End Products for Clients, transfer these End Products to your Clients, and charge them for your services.
Sell and create multiple copies of the End Products. This constitutes a "multi-use" license.
Adapt or merge the Content with other materials to create derivative works. Such creations are subject to this license. This clause also encompasses extracting individual components from the Content for use in derivative works.
However, there are restrictions:
You must not employ the Content for more editors than the number of licensed seats you possess. This license functions on a "per-seat" basis. If you intend to use the same Content for the benefit of additional editors, such as other designers on your team, you must obtain supplementary licenses.
Redistribution of the Content's source, even when modified, is not allowed, except as explicitly permitted herein.
The use of the Content in applications that enable End Users to customize it, such as "build it yourself" or "theme generators," is prohibited.
End Users of the End Product should not have access to the Content's source or use it separately from the End Product.
It's important to note that this license may be terminated if breached, resulting in the loss of your rights to use it or any works created under its provisions.

3. Restrictions on the use of content

Here are the restrictions you must adhere to:
Only use Content as explicitly permitted by the license you obtained for that particular Content.
Do not engage in the resale, redistribution, provision of access to, sharing, or transfer of any Content, unless expressly allowed in this agreement. For instance, this prohibition extends to the presentation of Content as part of a "gallery" where third parties can browse and select from the Content.
Avoid using Content in a way that violates the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or could result in claims of deceptive advertising or unfair competition.
Refrain from using any Content in a context that is pornographic, defamatory, deceptive, or potentially illegal.
