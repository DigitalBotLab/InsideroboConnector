### 1.1 Install Omniverse USD Composer

This project is currently targeted for `Omniverse USD Composer`. Please follow the instructions to install it first:

[USD Composer Overview](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/composer/latest/index.html#:~:text=NVIDIA%20Omniverse%E2%84%A2%20USD%20Composer,is%20based%20on%20Pixar's%20USD.)

### 1.2 Import the extension

To install the extension to Omniverse USD Composer:

First, clone the respository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigitalBotLab/InsideroboConnector
```

And now Open the `Omniverse USD Composer`, go to `Menu Bar` -> `Windows` -> `Extensions` -> `+` ->

Add your `<path_to_this_repository>/AssetProvider/dbl-exts-asset/exts`



## 2. Format: USD

Our digital robots are meticulously crafted and well-configured in .usd format, complete with physics, rigid bodies, and joints. This ensures a realistic and immersive experience when interacting with the robots within Omniverse.

## 3. ROS <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Ros_logo.svg" alt="Ros" width="70" height="70">

The Insiderobo Connector is built upon the foundation of the Robot Operating System (ROS), an open-source framework that empowers researchers and developers to easily build and reuse code across various robotics applications. This integration allows for enhanced collaboration, accelerated development, and seamless integration of digital robots into the Omniverse ecosystem.
